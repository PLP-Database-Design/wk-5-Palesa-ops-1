### Phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Actual Output | Variance | Owner |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Planning | Test Plan Document | Test Plan completed and reviewed on time | None | Test Manager |
| Design | Test Cases & Risk Matrix | 8 detailed test cases and 8 risk entries created | None | Test Analyst |
| Execution | Test Execution | Report All 8 test cases executed successfully |  None  | Test Executor |
|Monitoring | Daily Progress Logs & Defect Tracking | 3 defects logged and tracked on GitHub | None | Test Executor |
| Reporting | Final Test Summary Report | Consolidated report with metrics and lessons learned | In progress  | Test Manager |

**Progress Tracking Method:**  
Progress was tracked using GitHub Issues . Each team member updated daily status, while the Test Manager monitored completion rates and variance. Communication channels : WhatsApp group  ensured daily alignment.
**Change Control Notes:**
No major scope or requirement changes occurred during this test cycle. Minor edits were made to defect descriptions for clarity. The test schedule remained consistent with the original plan.
## Lessons Learned

- Most Defect Prone Feature: The Leaderboard feature showed the highest defect density due to data         
  persistence and sorting logic issues. 
- Risk Analysis Impact: Early identification of high-risk areas (reset logic and localStorage handling) 
  improved test coverage and minimized post-execution defects. 
- Team Communication Effectiveness: Communication was efficient and collaborative through group channels. 
  Each role clearly understood deliverables, ensuring timely task completion and consistent reporting. 
- Improvements for Next Cycle: Introduce automated regression testing for repeated verification.
  Expand cross-browser testing to include Firefox and Edge.
  Conduct weekly defect triage meetings to prioritize fixes early.
  Add screenshots and environment versioning for clearer documentation.
